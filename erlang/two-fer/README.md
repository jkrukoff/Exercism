# Two Fer

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

```text
"One for X, one for me."
```

When X is a name or "you".

If the given name is "Alice", the result should be "One for Alice, one for me."
If no name is given, the result should be "One for you, one for me."


## Running tests

In order to run the tests, issue the following command from the exercise
directory:

For running the tests provided, `rebar3` is used as it is the official build and
dependency management tool for erlang now. Please refer to [the tracks installation
instructions](http://exercism.io/languages/erlang/installation) on how to do that.

In order to run the tests, you can issue the following command from the exercise
directory.

```bash
$ rebar3 eunit
```

### Test versioning

Each problem defines a macro `TEST_VERSION` in the test file and
verifies that the solution defines and exports a function `test_version`
returning that same value.

To make tests pass, add the following to your solution:

```erlang
-export([test_version/0]).

test_version() ->
  1.
```

The benefit of this is that reviewers can see against which test version
an iteration was written if, for example, a previously posted solution
does not solve the current problem or passes current tests.
